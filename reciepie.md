Method:
In a wide mixing bowl add wheat flour, salt and first give a quick mix for salt to be even. Then add water little by little, gather to form a soft pliable dough.Once it is gathered to a mass add 1/2 tsp oil and knead it once.The dough should not be too tight or too loose, it should be non sticky at this stage.Allow it to rest for a while until we prepare the sauce.


Blanch tomatoes till its skin starts to peel off by itself, drain water, remove the skin and trim the edge.Cut into half and transfer to a mixer.


Grind it to a smooth puree without adding water.Set aside.Heat oil in a kadai – add garlic and saute till golden brown, then add onion and saute till transparent.

Then add tomato puree and let it boil for 3mins.Then add tomato sauce,pepper powder,chilli flakes and oregano and let it cook until the sauce is thick.Once the sauce comes together to a thick spreadable consistency switch off and set aside.

Get ready with your ingredients.Toast capsicum in 1/2 tsp oil till it shrinks a bit.Take chapathi dough and start rolling into slightly thick chapathi’s.

Heat a pan, cook chapathi on both sides.I removed the tawa from flame and then arranged the toppings.Spread the sauce.

Spread the veggies, such that it covers the whole chapathi.Finally add grated cheese and then carefully transfer the tawa to flame.Cook covered till cheese melts.
